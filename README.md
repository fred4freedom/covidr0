# Introduction

This is based on the idea from `https://rt.live/` to track how the reproductive number is evolving with the measures being taken in Singapore. This is whole lifted from their work and applied to the data in Singapore. *no further work or modelling has been done yet*

# Problems

The model assumes good detection of the new cases appearing in the community, but as we can see in the outbreak of the dorm workers, detection is not perfect, and in such cases the model will break down.
The hyperparameter tuning is not properly done yet also, so need to take the results with a pinch of salt.
